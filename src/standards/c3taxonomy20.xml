Geospatial Web Map Tile Services trade the flexibility of custom map rendering for the scalability possible by serving of static data (base maps) where the bounding box and scales have been constrained to discrete tiles which enables the use of standard network mechanisms for scalability such as distributed cache systems to cache images between the client and the server, reducing latency and bandwidth use.&#xA;&#xA;The service advertises the tiles it has available through a standardized declaration in the ServiceMetadata document common to all geospatial web services. This declaration defines the tiles available in each layer (i.e. each type of content), in each graphical representation style, in each format, in each coordinate reference system, at each scale, and over each geographic fragment of the total covered area. The ServiceMetadata document also declares the communication protocols and encodings through which clients can interact with the server.

The granularity of the services described in this taxonomy is such that even the lowest level communications service, e.g. a user typing short free-text messages on a keypad and transmitting them over a UHF satcom DAMA radio, can be represented.&#xA;&#xA;The required granularity is achieved by defining elementary service blocks. These are building blocks in complex end-to-end services, as those formulated in the NSOVs of the relevant reference architectures and derived target architectures. Elementary service blocks are agnostic to the resources and solutions that service providers can adopt to implement them and can be implemented over different communications segments (terrestrial, radio, satcom), by different service providers.&#xA;&#xA;By concatenating these elementary services as building blocks, service architects can streamline and specify any complex communications service, end-to-end (e.g. DCIS service). In particular:&#xA;* Service blocks are concatenated to follow the flow of information, in a way similar to the actual communications infrastructure that is physically supporting the services. That makes the resulting Comms Service Maps understandable by network architects, service managers, and service providers. Comms Service Maps can be exported and used for a variety of purposes, from service level specification, to service management and control. &#xA;* Comms maps are two-dimensional representations of a complex communications service. Each service block along the chain can be assigned to different service providers, and clear interface and service delivery or service peering boundaries can be defined between them.&#xA;* Service providers can select and involve the resources and the technical solutions that best meet the service level specifications for each block, under the constraints posed by the operational context, and by the connectivity/interaction with adjacent service blocks (implemented by other service providers). These constraints shall be reflected in the service level specification. &#xA;* In the NATO context, service providers can be NATO organic providersproviders (e.g. NCI Agency, e.g. providing Access Services), a NATO Nation or a consortium/group of nations (e.g. providing Transport Services and Transmission Services over military-controlled communications infrastructure), as well as commercial providers (e.g. providing Transmission Services over commercial infrastructure)."

Because they are defined end-to-end, in a comms service map, the same Access Service block can be found at both ends of the link, and will often (but not necessarily) be implemented and managed by the same service provider.&#xA;&#xA;Communications Access Services correspond to customer-facing communications services. As such, they can also be referred to as Subscriber Services, or Customer-Edge (CE) Services. In most cases, they involve the direct connection of hosts or end-user devices that interface the service on a given layer of the communications stack.&#xA;&#xA;The Communications Access Services nomenclature is based on the type of end-to-end access service supported between the Communications/computing devices."

                     description="The Transmission Services cover the physical layer (also referred to as media layer or air-interface in wireless/satellite (SATCOM) communications) supporting Transport Services, as well as Communications Access Services. Support for the latter is relevant to personal communications systems, in which the User Appliances directly connect to the transmission element without any transport elements in between.&#xA;&#xA;Transmission Services are confined to the assets dealing with the adaptation to the transmission media (i.e. line drivers, adapters, transceivers, transmitters, and radiating elements (e.g. antennas). In some cases this adaption will include the modem, but in other cases the modem will be associated with Transport Services when implementing the first stage of the media-adaptation process (e.g. coding,  modulation). The second stage, involving frequency conversion, amplification, radiation, bent-pipe transponder relay, etc., will be covered under Transmission Services proper.&#xA;&#xA;The Transmission Services nomenclature is based on the service categories wired or wireless (including SATCOM) and coverage (i.e. local, metro, wide, and LOS, BLOS). Additionally in the case of wireless the terms static or mobile are employed. Categorising the transmission services in this manner is considered to be intuitive, &#34;military service&#34; agnostic, combines both wireless-radio and SATCOM under the single term &#34;wireless&#34; thus resulting in fewer service categories and excludes cross referencing."

Antennas are essential components of all equipment that uses radio and are usually used with a radio transmitter or radio receiver. Antennas can also be used as sensor equipment. &#xA;&#xA;According to their applications and technology available, antennas generally fall in one of two categories:&#xA;# Omnidirectional or only weakly directional antennas which receive or radiate more or less in all directions. These are employed when the relative position of the other station is unknown or arbitrary. They are also used at lower frequencies where a directional antenna would be too large, or simply to cut costs in applications where a directional antenna isn't required.&#xA;# Directional or beam antennas which are intended to preferentially radiate or receive in a particular direction or directional pattern."

                  description="A Telecommunication Cable is a type of guided transmission medium. Cables are usually known to transmit electric energy (AC/DC) but in telecommunications fields, cables are used to transmit electromagnetic waves, they are called electromagnetic wave guides. Telecommunications are based on transmitting modulated waves/signals through a medium and receiving them. When the distance between the transmitter and receiver is far, or we are using unguided medium transmission, the antennas are used, otherwise in guided medium transmission, the telecommunication cables are used. &#xA;&#xA;Telecommunication cables are divided into several types: Waveguides when electromagnetic waves are transmitted; Transmission Lines when electric signals are transmitted; and Optical Fibers when light signals are transmitted.&#xA;&#xA;International standard '''ISO/IEC 11801''' specifies general-purpose telecommunication cabling systems (structured cabling) that are suitable for a wide range of applications (analog and ISDN telephony, various data communication standards, building control and automation systems). It covers both balanced copper cabling and optical fibre cabling. The standard was optimized for premises that span up to 3Â km, up to 1Â kmÂ² office space, with between 50 and 50,000 persons, but can also be applied for installations outside this range. A corresponding standard for small-office/home-office (SOHO) environments is ISO/IEC 15018, which also covers 1.2Â GHz links for cable and satellite TV applications."
